# Transformation
Downloading the dataset from the dataset online. CSV file and export it into the PowerBI.
Tranferring the file into the Power Query Editor for transformation and verifying the data types and columns. Adjusting the columns and data data types where necessary. Appemding all the similar tables together inorder to have a complete table of the world cup dataset from 2002-2018.
After transformation, I closed and applied and created a rolling calender using DAX function from the data view.

I navigated to the model view and crested relationships with the data linking the facts tables to the dimension table. 

Having modelled the data, I created measures with DAX and created my Dashboard. Joining several tiles together, measures and using slicers to navigate and filter through the dashboard.

# The Story: FIFA - Football World Cup Case Study
The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an
international association football competition contested by the
senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération
Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global
governing body. The championship has been awarded every four
years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and
1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The
current champion is France, which won its second title at the 2018
tournament in Russia.

The 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national
teams. Brazil have won five times, and they are the only team to have
played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are
Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, France, and
inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and
Spain, with one title each.
